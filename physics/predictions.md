# Coherism: Falsifiable Predictions and Experimental Protocols

This document outlines four concrete, falsifiable predictions of the Coherism framework. The primary and most immediate test is the **Analog Gravity Density Modulation** experiment, which offers an effective coupling enhancement of $\sim 60$ orders of magnitude compared to gravitational tests.

## 1. Primary Experimental Test: Analog Gravity Density Modulation

**Status:** Primary Near-Term Test  
**Predicted Magnitude:** $\delta\rho/\rho_0 \sim 10^{-6}$

In a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) simulating a black hole (sonic horizon), Coherism predicts a specific density ripple near the horizon caused by the informational stress tensor ($\Theta_{\mu\nu}$) of coherent phonons. This effect is distinct from the backreaction of spontaneous Hawking radiation (vacuum fluctuations) due to the macroscopic coherence of the injected pulse.

### Experimental Protocol
1.  **Setup:** Create a "draining vortex" or "waterfall" potential in a 2D $^{87}$Rb BEC (standard configuration in labs like JILA, MIT, Technion).
2.  **Injection:** Inject a **coherent phonon pulse** (sound wave) toward the sonic horizon using Bragg spectroscopy or a localized potential paddle.
    * *Control:* Inject a thermal phonon pulse of equivalent energy.
3.  **Measurement:** Use phase-contrast imaging to photograph the density profile near the horizon with high spatial resolution.

### Prediction vs. Null Hypothesis

* **Coherism Prediction:** A stationary density modulation of order $\delta\rho/\rho_0 \sim 10^{-6}$ appears *only* for the coherent pulse and vanishes (or is suppressed by orders of magnitude) for the thermal control.
* **Standard Physics (Null):** The density profile remains smooth to $10^{-7}$ precision, or shows no statistically significant difference between coherent and thermal pulses of equal energy (accounting for standard non-linearities).

### Novelty
Existing experiments focus on the passive backreaction of spontaneous Hawking radiation (quantum noise). This protocol proposes an **active, driven test** using a coherent driver to amplify the informational stress term $\Theta_{\mu\nu}$, turning a "noise hunting" experiment into a high-signal-to-noise "response" experiment.

## 2. Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) Violation

**Status:** Secondary Test (Requires High Precision)  
**Predicted Magnitude:** $\eta \approx 10^{-15}$ (at current MICROSCOPE bound)

Coherism predicts that a "coherent" object falls with a slightly different acceleration than a "classical" (incoherent) object of the exact same mass and energy, due to the coupling of the coherence functional to the background geometry.

### Experimental Protocol
1.  **Setup:** Vacuum drop tower or fountain.
2.  **Test Masses:**
    * Mass A: Bose-Einstein Condensate ($^{87}$Rb), representing a macroscopic coherent state.
    * Mass B: Thermal gas of $^{87}$Rb, representing an incoherent state.
3.  **Procedure:** Perform a simultaneous differential free-fall test.

### Prediction

* **Coherism:** $\eta = \frac{a_{BEC} - a_{thermal}}{a_{avg}} \approx 10^{-15}$.
* **Falsification:** A null result at $10^{-16}$ precision would constrain the gravitational coupling $\kappa$ to be negligible for this effect.

## 3. Atom Interferometer Phase Shift

**Status:** Secondary Test  
**Predicted Magnitude:** $\delta\phi/\phi \sim 10^{-11}$

The "informational weight" of a spatial superposition creates an additional phase shift in an atom interferometer, beyond the standard gravitational phase shift.

### Experimental Protocol
1.  **Setup:** Large-baseline atom interferometer (e.g., 10m towers).
2.  **Measurement:** Measure the phase shift accumulated by atoms in a large spatial superposition.

### Prediction

* **Coherism:** A fractional deviation of $\delta\phi/\phi \sim 10^{-11}$ from the standard GR prediction ($k_{eff} g T^2$).
* **Falsification:** Null result at $10^{-12}$ precision.

## 4. Cosmological "Dark Energy" Shift

**Status:** Outlook / Future Work (Appendix Only)  
**Predicted Magnitude:** Tensor-to-scalar ratio correction ~ 10⁻¹⁰

> **Note:** This prediction is phenomenological and not rigorously derived. It has been moved to the appendix in the current manuscript and is not part of the primary falsification pathway.

The universe's expansion history could deviate from ΛCDM if "coherence energy" has an equation of state w ≈ -0.994 rather than exactly -1.

### Protocol

* Analyze next-generation CMB data (e.g., CMB-S4) for specific deviations.
* *Note:* This effect is likely too small to distinguish without corroborating evidence from the BEC experiment.

## 5. The Distinguishing Test: Coherent vs. Thermal

**Status:** *Experimentum Crucis*
**Predicted Magnitude:** $\eta_{\mathrm{coh}} \sim 10^{-15}$

This is the **unique signature** that distinguishes Coherism from competing frameworks (Penrose-Diósi, stochastic gravity).

### Why This Test Matters

| Framework | Coherent vs. Thermal Distinction? |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| **Coherism** | **Yes** — Different Θ_μν for same energy |
| Penrose-Diósi | No — Based on superposition size, not coherence |
| Stochastic Gravity | No — Same ⟨T_μν⟩ for both |

### Experimental Protocol (Distinguishing Test)

Compare free-fall acceleration of:

* **Sample A:** BEC of N atoms (coherent)
* **Sample B:** Thermal gas of N atoms (incoherent)

Both have identical mass, energy, and density. Only Coherism predicts a difference.

## Summary: The Critical Path

**Focus:** The **Analog Gravity (BEC)** experiment is the critical path for validation.

* **Why:** The effective coupling in the analog system is $\sim 60$ orders of magnitude stronger than in gravitational systems.
* **Feasibility:** Requires standard cold-atom laboratory hardware (2D BEC, draining vortex, imaging).
* **Verdict:** A null result in the BEC density modulation test ($< 10^{-7}$) would falsify the analog gravity predictions and cast significant doubt on the gravitational implementation. A positive result ($\sim 10^{-6}$) specific to coherent injection would provide the first direct evidence of informational backreaction.
